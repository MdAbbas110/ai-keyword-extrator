# React + Vite + Key Extractor using react

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Idea behind this app is to make use of open AI and genreate some Keywords based on the text**

- Used ChakraUI for the userInterface of the app that is really helpfull and easy way to immplent it in your react apps
- There is also api call to the openAi and that is the most intreating part about this project
- How to setup the api request to the open ai with a integrated prompt in the rqeust it self
- But due to my open ai free credit was been expired and can't able to request to that api so i stoped the project in between
